Stylesheet: Retina Screens & Devices
@Retina

When handling retina screens you need to make adjustments, 
especially if you're not using font icons. Here you can add 
them in one neat place.

	/* 
	EXAMPLE 
	Let's say you have an image and you need to make sure it looks ok
	on retina screens. Let's say we have an icon which dimension are
	20.250em x 20.250em. In your regular stylesheets, it would look something
	like this:
	
	.icon {
		width: 20.250em;
		height: 20.250em;
		background: url(img/test.png) no-repeat;
	}
	
	For retina screens, we have to make some adjustments, so that image
	doesn't look blurry. So, taking into account the image above and the
	dimensions, this is what we would put in our retina stylesheet:
	
	.icon {
		background: url(img/test@2x.png) no-repeat;
		background-size: 20.250em 20.250em;
	}
	
	So, you would create the same icon, but at double the resolution, meaning 
	it would be 48px x 48px. You'd name it the same, but with a @2x at the end
	(this is pretty standard practice). Set the background image so it matches
	the original dimensions and you are good to go.
